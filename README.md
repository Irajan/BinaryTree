 <h1>Binary Tree</h1>
In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

<h1>AVL Balancing</h1>
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

<h3>
  This is a web app visualizes how AVL balancing is performed on Binary Tree
</h3>

Steps
<ul>
  <li>Run the app</li>
  <li>Press right buttom of the mouse </li>
  <li>Enter the integer numbers </li>
  <li>You will get binary tree on left side and AVL balanced tree on the right side</li>
  </ul>
